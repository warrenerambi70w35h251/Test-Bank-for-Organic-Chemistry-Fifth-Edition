  * Written by two expert teachers, the Fifth Edition of Organic Chemistry is written to support all kinds of learners―whether students read the book, or use it as a reference. New “Visualize, Understand, Draw” sections help students draw molecules well, visualize how they are formed, and understand why reactions occur. The Fifth Edition has been revised to be more accessible, with a focus on the basics and more opportunities for problem-solving practice, while the robust media package helps students visualize organic chemistry.
